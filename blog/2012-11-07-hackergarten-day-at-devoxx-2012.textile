p(lead). In less than one week, open source developers will gather in Antwerp, Belgium for an all day Hackergarten hosted by "Devoxx":http://twitter.com/Devoxx and "Andres Almiray":http://twitter.com/aalmiray. Contributors from projects such as Gradle, "Fedora Java":http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Java, Scala, "Arquillian":http://arquillian.org/blog/, CRaSH, Groovy, Drools, FluentLenium, Hibernate, Grails, Dart, JavaFX, and many, many more will be working on integrations, new features and patches. 

This will be a great opportunity to work side by side on your favorite open source project with other contributors, learn new skills, and meet open source hackers.

h3. By the way, did I mention the Hackergarten is free?

If you're in or near Antwerp, please come by and join us! Introduce us to your open source project, discover the benefits of other projects, brainstorm some new features, and hack hard (it makes the beer taste so superb later that night).
