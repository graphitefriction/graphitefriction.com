  </h2>
  <h4>Tuesday, August 14, 2012</h4>
  <p class="lead">At <span class="caps">OSCON</span> 2012 in Portland, OR the Fedora booth may have been small, but it packed a full cast of characters and crowd-gathering technology. Beefy Miracle waved from atop the Fedora marquee and Tux stopped by for a few hours each day. Few attendees could resist posing for a picture with Tux or snagging a Beefy Miracle sticker to embellish their laptop.</p>

<h3>Fedora on a Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>The Fedora booth showcased the features and capabilities of Fedora running on a Raspberry Pi (a cheap, low-power computer that features an <span class="caps">ARM</span> processor). People were in awe that a tiny system on a chip (SoC) could support a widescreen monitor and an external hard drive and run full length movies at 1080p resolution with no problems (except when I overheated the chip by leaving my laptop next to it (my bad!)).</p>
<p>Common Raspberry Pi questions included:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Is that a Raspberry Pi?</dt>
	<dd>Yes</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>What operating system is it running?</dt>
	<dd>Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix (armv5hl), maintained by the Fedora <span class="caps">ARM</span> team</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>What is the desktop?</dt>
	<dd><span class="caps">XFCE</span></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>What is the graphics card brand?</dt>
	<dd>A Broadcom VideoCore IV, OpenGL ES 2.0, that is capable of 1080p, 30 h.264/<span class="caps">MPEG</span>-4 <span class="caps">AVC</span> high-profile decoder. The output connections are Composite <span class="caps">RCA</span> or <span class="caps">HDMI</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Does it have on board memory?</dt>
	<dd>No. You have to boot from SD but a <span class="caps">USB</span> HD can &#8220;take over&#8221; after the initial boot. You cannot boot without an SD card. Supported card formats include SD, <span class="caps">MMC</span>, and <span class="caps">SDIO</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>How is it powered?</dt>
	<dd>The device is powered by 5V micro <span class="caps">USB</span>. The device could also be run by 4 AA batteries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>Can it display at 1080?</dt>
	<dd>Yes</dd>
</dl>
<p>Our setup used an external hard drive connected via <span class="caps">USB</span> because the SD card was only large enough to fit Futurama episodes (in 720), not the full length Tron Legacy movie Spot had on hand.</p>
<p>For more information about the Raspberry Pi hardware, refer to the <a href="/http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs">Raspberry Pi Foundation&#8217;s FAQs</a>. Visit <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM">Fedora <span class="caps">ARM</span></a> to learn more about how Fedora is developing architectures for SoC.</p>
<h3>Tux Photobooth</h3>
<p>The Raspberry Pi ran the semi-automated photography booth. Hooked up to a camera and using a python script, the Pi snapped photos of the attendees posed with Tux. Attendees could then scan the QR code generated by the script and displayed in the web browser to retrieve their picture later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/oscon2012/fedora_photo_booth.png" title="Fedora photobooth" alt="Fedora photobooth" /></p>
<p>The first photobooth session occurred on Tuesday night, during the opening of the expo floor. During the ever-popular <span class="caps">OSCON</span> booth crawl on Wednesday night, Tux returned to the photobooth and later toured the expo floor to meet his fans.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing fact:</strong> <em>Tux can write python code with his wings!</em> Prior to the session on Wednesday, Tux took a few moments to modify the python program that captures, scales, and posts the pictures when the usual Nikon was replaced with a Canon (new drivers had to be loaded). The equipment and instructions to host your own Raspberry Pi photobooth are being drafted on the new <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_photobooth">Raspberry Pi photobooth wikipage</a>.</p>

<h3>Fedora Packages Search App</h3>
<p>I did field a few questions about Fedora 17&#8217;s development environment and got to point out the servers and frameworks packaged in Fedora 17. There was also a question about the latest <span class="caps">KVM</span> virt-manager instance. I&#8217;m just learning about virtual machine technologies, and version numbers are not my strong point. However, this allowed me to show off the <a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/virt-manager">Fedora Packages Search</a> app (using Firefox on the Pi!). If you&#8217;re not familiar with the Fedora packages search app, you need to check it out. It rocks!  You can quickly find out if the program you&#8217;re interested in is packaged, which version is packaged in which release, what updates are coming, and much more all within a clean, easy to use web interface.</p>
<p>I use the packages search app almost every day as I continue to learn more about Fedora&#8217;s features, release cycle, and the awesome people dedicated to adding new and improved programs and capabilities to Fedora.</p>
<h3>Photographs</h3>
<p>You can find more pictures from <span class="caps">OSCON</span> 2012 on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/graphitefriction/sets/72157630714547678/">photostream</a>. Mark Terranova (MarkDude) also took great photographs of the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/105095769731159704550/albums/5769140764406115713">Fedora booth and Beefy Miracle&#8217;s expo floor adventures</a> at <span class="caps">OSCON</span>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who stopped by the booth!</p>

    <p class="byline">Saturday August 4, 2012 2:25 PM &#8211; 3:10 PM</p>
    <p>Since the mid 1990s the Useless Use of Cat Award has raised awareness of a class of shell script constructs that make some laugh and others cry. Demoggification is the process of removing useless cats. This talk covers a variety of other useless stuff (including echo, grep, sed, nc, and more) that frequently finds its way into our shell scripts and shows how to demoggify each by using various features in bash.</p>
    <p>Features covered include direct access to sockets, parameter expansions, brace expansions, here strings, and more.</p>

    <p>Thomas Cameron (<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Tcameron">Tcameron</a>), Red Hat&#8217;s chief architect for Canada and the central US, will show how scaling out with software based on <a href="http://www.gluster.org/">Gluster</a> will defy future data storage and transfer resource constraints.</p>

    <p class="byline">Saturday August 4, 2012 3:20 PM &#8211; 4:05 PM</p>
    <p>Gluster is a software-based, scale-out network-attached storage (<span class="caps">NAS</span>) appliance. It uses inexpensive internal or direct-attached (e.g. <span class="caps">JBOD</span>) storage and pools multiple servers into one storage namespace. This pooled storage is then exported to Linux clients via <span class="caps">NFS</span>, to Microsoft Windows clients via <span class="caps">CIFS</span>/Samba, or using the native Gluster client. In this session, Red Hat&#8217;s Thomas Cameron will explain the architecture of Gluster and demonstrate setting up a 3-node storage cluster, including setting up the <span class="caps">NFS</span> service, Samba, and the native Gluster client. He will demonstrate mirrored content, distributed content, and discuss geo-replication (stretch clusters).</p>

  <h4>Thursday, July 5, 2012</h4>
  <p class="lead">Representing <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Summit_2012">Fedora at the Summit</a> sounded great when I was safely ensconced in my office, chatting on <span class="caps">IRC</span>, weeks before the event.  But once I approached the booth at the Hynes Convention Center, a horde of heebie-jeebies streaked down my spine screaming, <strong><em>Run away! Run away!</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Face to face, live action conversation? It can&#8217;t be paused, reconsidered or erased. Answering direct questions without the luxury of composing my thoughts on paper? Why, oh why hasn&#8217;t anyone invented a delete key for my mouth!</p>
<p>During the first full day of booth activities, I retreated behind my cameras to document the constant activity in the Fedora Community area. I photographed attendees visiting the Fedora booth, hanging with Beefy Miracle, and enjoying the mid-afternoon hot dog snack hour. All of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/graphitefriction/">photographs I took during the Summit</a> are posted on my Flickr stream.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/fedorasummit2012/fedora_booth_friends.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/fedorasummit2012/beefymiracle_mustard.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I also recorded two talks presented in the Fedora Community area: Ryan O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s <em>Network Load Balancing for the 21st Century With Keepalived and HAProxy</em> and Dan Allen&#8217;s <em>JBoss AS7 on Fedora</em> as well as the server and system installation for the next day&#8217;s Fedora <span class="caps">ARM</span> demonstration. Once I finish processing the videos, I&#8217;ll post them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/fedorasummit2012/ryanohara_loadbalance.jpg" title="Ryan O&#39;Hara" alt="Ryan O&#39;Hara" /> <img src="/images/fedorasummit2012/danallen_as7onfedora.jpg" title="Dan Allen" alt="Dan Allen" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/fedorasummit2012/jonmasters_arm_demo.jpg" title="Jon Masters" alt="Jon Masters" /></p>
<p>On Thursday, after Jon Masters&#8217; crowd-gathering <span class="caps">ARM</span> demonstration, I forced myself to stow the cameras. I took position behind the booth, no camera lenses or laptop to filter my I/O. The gaps in my knowledge soon became apparent.</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;"><strong>No, I&#8217;m not familiar with the wide variety of acronyms applied to the hardware in the one laptop per per child computer or what version of Fedora it is running.</strong> Luke Macken saved the attendee from my panicky stare, and now I know it&#8217;s an <span class="caps">ARM</span> processor, running Sugar on a Stick, and the newest laptop has a much better keyboard.</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;"><strong>I don&#8217;t know what version of Apache httpd is packaged in Fedora 17.</strong> Tom Callaway fired up a terminal and found the information. <a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/httpd">2.2.22</a>.</p>
<p>And the most popular question at the booth:</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;"><strong>How did Beefy Miracle come to be named Beefy Miracle?</strong> After numerous attempts, I realized I couldn&#8217;t succinctly explain the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Guidelines_for_release_names">Fedora release naming process steps</a> in the correct order. Ruth Suehle, Sandro Mathys and Tom had to save people from my disordered explanations numerous times. They can iterate the naming process without blinking.</p>
<p>However, I did answer questions regarding one of the new items at the booth, the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/JBossAS7">AS 7 on Fedora 17</a> flyer.  I can recite the commands to install the AS 7 package, start, stop and deploy it, what is and isn&#8217;t currently in the packaged profile, what&#8217;s on deck to be in updated releases, and where to find help and participate with AS 7 and future packaging goals.  I was stumped though when asked about the differences between Fedora and AS 7 versus another distribution and Websphere.  I need to brush up on the features of other application servers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a well-rounded Fedora representative yet, but manning the booth was a huge kickstart. I learned the answers to tons of questions from the other Fedora representatives and discovered the concerns of potential and current Fedora users. The best thing about volunteering at the booth was meeting so many great people: the conference attendees who visited the booth and the Fedora advocates I had previously only chatted with on <span class="caps">IRC</span>. I can&#8217;t thank everyone enough times for answering my questions or for sorting through my jumbled explanations.</p>
<p>Oh, there are two questions I can confidently respond to now without pause or consideration because Ruth wrote down the answers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Yes, it is a Raspberry Pi. No, you can&#8217;t have it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/fedorasummit2012/raspberrypi_fedora17.jpg" alt="" /></p>
