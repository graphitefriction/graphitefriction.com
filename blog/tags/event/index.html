  <p>That was a popular exchange at the Fedora booth during this year&#8217;s <a href="http://ohiolinux.org">Ohio LinuxFest</a>. The iconic Model B Raspberry Pi, running Fedora Remix and proudly displaying the Beefy Miracle fireworks on a XFCE desktop, was drawing lots of attention.</p>

  <p>As OLF attendees quickly discovered, using the desktop requires a little extra patience since the libraries aren&#8217;t (yet) optimized for the hardware. But, don&#8217;t underestimate this board. It packs a powerful punch and future releases plan to take full advantage of its capabilities to speed up execution of the programs.

  <div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>A Raspberry Pi is a system-on-a-chip (SoC) single-board computer. In other words, it&#8217;s an incredibly compact general purpose computer. It even fits inside one of my mini pie dishes. <em>Mmmm</em>, pie!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s back up and begin with the central component that makes this all possible, the ARM chip.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM chips</a> are the most widely-produced processors in the world because they are small, cheap and require minimal power. They are found in smart phones, tablets, routers, embedded controllers, gaming consoles and streaming digital media devices. As the chips become more powerful and SoCs less expensive, consumer operating systems such as Fedora can be installed on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Several companies manufacture and sell ARM-based SoC computers priced under $100 that are specifically designed for you to install your Linux distribution of choice. The Raspberry Pi is notable for its $35 price tag, less than half the price of the next cheapest ARM-based SoC, the $89 BeagleBone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Raspberry Pi Model B is based on the Broadcom BCM2835 SoC and includes these components and ports:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p>ARM1176JZF-S 700 MHz processor (<a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/classic/arm11">ARM11 family</a>, armv6 architecture)</p>
      
    </li>

  <p>Single-board systems like the Raspberry Pi aren&#8217;t just miniaturized computers locked in a box, though. They&#8217;re open, development boards with general inputs and outputs (GPIOs) that allow expansion through add-on boards and external devices. Installing a Linux distribution like Fedora is just the first step of becoming a <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekmom/2012/10/open-hardware-summit-2012">maker</a>!</p>

  <div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>It begins with the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM">Fedora ARM project</a>, an initiative to port Fedora to the ARM processor family. The group has successfully created <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/Fedora_17_GA">Fedora 17 GA images</a> for single-board computers including the BeagleBoard, SheevaPlug, PandaBoard, and Trim-Slice. However, the Fedora Project does not yet produce an official release for the Raspberry Pi due to certain licensing issues. Specifically, the Raspberry Pi relies upon a custom kernel (not upstream) as well as special GPU binary blobs which are not acceptable under the current firmware exception in Fedora.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>But, if you want Fedora 17 on your Pi <strong>today</strong>, do not despair! There&#8217;s a Fedora Remix for that!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Seneca College&#8217;s <a href="http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/">Centre for Development of Open Source Technology</a> maintains the <a href="http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Raspberry_Pi_Fedora_Remix">Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix</a>. A <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix">Fedora Remix</a> is a combination of Fedora software, with or without add-ons, that any community member can create at any time to produce interesting and compelling distributions. The Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix enables you load Fedora 17 onto the Pi and get updates for most software from the official Fedora yum repositories (armv5tel architecture). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbWE6qF7pIM">Watch the announcement video</a> to learn more about how the folks from Sececa built and tested it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>The Fedora ARM group is working to make ARM a primary Fedora architecture for all future releases and to expand support to additional SoCs, including the Raspberry Pi. Until Fedora officially supports the Raspberry Pi, you&#8217;ll need to use the Fedora Remix.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Let&#8217;s take it one question at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><strong>How do I get a Raspberry Pi?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>You may have heard that you need to know the right people to get your hands on a Raspberry Pi or that there is a purchasing restriction. Neither of those rumors are true anymore, though you may still run into backorders. Numerous distributors<sup>&#8224;</sup> sell the Pi, including <a href="http://www.alliedelec.com/lp/120626raso/?cm_mmc=Offline-Referral-">http://www.alliedelec.com/lp/120626raso/?cm_mmc=Offline-Referral-</a><em>-Electronics-</em>-RaspberryPi-201203-_-World-Selector-Page[Allied Electronics], <a href="http://www.newark.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?id=83T1943&amp;Ntt=83T1943">Newark</a>, <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/category/105">Adafruit Industries</a> and <a href="http://www.mcmelectronics.com/content/en-US/raspberry-pi">MCM Electronics</a> but be prepared to wait (last minute holiday shoppers, you&#8217;ve been warned!). MCM Electronics and Adafruit also sell an array of accessories like the clear case that houses my Pi, shown below.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p><strong>How do I load Fedora Remix on it?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Once you receive your slice of Pi, the next step is to install Fedora Remix or one of the other <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Distributions">Raspberry Pi (RPi) Linux distributions</a> onto a MicroSD card and slide it into the board.

  <p>At OSCON 2012 in Portland, OR the Fedora booth may have been small, but it packed a full cast of characters and crowd-gathering technology. Beefy Miracle waved from atop the Fedora marquee and Tux stopped by for a few hours each day. Few attendees could resist posing for a picture with Tux or snagging a Beefy Miracle sticker to embellish their laptop.</p>

  <p>The Fedora booth showcased the features and capabilities of Fedora running on a Raspberry Pi (a cheap, low-power computer that features an ARM processor). People were in awe that a tiny system on a chip (SoC) could support a widescreen monitor and an external hard drive and run full length movies at 1080p resolution with no problems (except when I overheated the chip by leaving my laptop next to it (my bad!)).</p>

  <p>I did field a few questions about Fedora 17&#8217;s development environment and got to point out the servers and frameworks packaged in Fedora 17. There was also a question about the latest KVM virt-manager instance. I&#8217;m just learning about virtual machine technologies, and version numbers are not my strong point. However, this allowed me to show off the <a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/virt-manager">Fedora Packages Search</a> app (using Firefox on the Pi!). If you&#8217;re not familiar with the Fedora packages search app, you need to check it out. It rocks!

  <p>Gluster is a software-based, scale-out network-attached storage (NAS) appliance. It uses inexpensive internal or direct-attached (e.g. JBOD) storage and pools multiple servers into one storage namespace. This pooled storage is then exported to Linux clients via NFS, to Microsoft Windows clients via CIFS/Samba, or using the native Gluster client. In this session, Red Hat&#8217;s Thomas Cameron will explain the architecture of Gluster and demonstrate setting up a 3-node storage cluster, including setting up the NFS service, Samba, and the native Gluster client. He will demonstrate mirrored content, distributed content, and discuss geo-replication (stretch clusters).</p>

  <p>Representing <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Summit_2012">Fedora at the Summit</a> sounded great when I was safely ensconced in my office, chatting on IRC, weeks before the event.  But once I approached the booth at the Hynes Convention Center, a horde of heebie-jeebies streaked down my spine screaming, <strong><em>Run away! Run away!</em></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Face to face, live action conversation? It can&#8217;t be paused, reconsidered or erased. Answering direct questions without the luxury of composing my thoughts on paper? Why, oh why hasn&#8217;t anyone invented a delete key for my mouth!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>During the first full day of booth activities, I retreated behind my cameras to document the constant activity in the Fedora Community area. I photographed attendees visiting the Fedora booth, hanging with Beefy Miracle, and enjoying the mid-afternoon hot dog snack hour. All of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/graphitefriction">photographs I took during the Summit</a> are posted on my Flickr stream.</p>

  <p>I also recorded two talks presented in the Fedora Community area: Ryan O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s <em>Network Load Balancing for the 21st Century With Keepalived and HAProxy</em> and Dan Allen&#8217;s <em>JBoss AS7 on Fedora</em> as well as the server and system installation for the next day&#8217;s Fedora ARM demonstration. Once I finish processing the videos, I&#8217;ll post them.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>On Thursday, after Jon Masters' crowd-gathering ARM demonstration, I forced myself to stow the cameras. I took position behind the booth, no camera lenses or laptop to filter my I/O. The gaps in my knowledge soon became apparent.</p>
</div>

<div class="qlist qanda unnumbered">
  
  <ol>
  
    <li>
      <p><em><strong>No, I&#8217;m not familiar with the wide variety of acronyms applied to the hardware in the one laptop per per child computer or what version of Fedora it is running.</strong></em></p>
      
      
      <p>Luke Macken saved the attendee from my panicky stare, and now I know it&#8217;s an ARM processor, running Sugar on a Stick, and the newest laptop has a much better keyboard.</p>
      
      
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><em><strong>I don&#8217;t know what version of Apache httpd is packaged in Fedora 17</strong></em></p>
      
      
      <p>Tom Callaway fired up a terminal and found the information. <a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/httpd">2.2.22</a>.</p>
      
      
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>And the most popular question at the booth:</p>
</div>

      
      
    </li>
  
    <li>
      <p><em><strong>How did Beefy Miracle come to be named Beefy Miracle?</strong></em></p>
      
      
      <p>After numerous attempts, I realized I couldn&#8217;t succinctly explain the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Guidelines_for_release_names">Fedora release naming process steps</a> in the correct order. Ruth Suehle, Sandro Mathys and Tom had to save people from my disordered explanations numerous times. They can iterate the naming process without blinking.</p>
      
      
      
    </li>
  
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>However, I did answer questions regarding one of the new items at the booth, the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/JBossAS7">AS 7 on Fedora 17</a> flyer.  I can recite the commands to install the AS 7 package, start, stop and deploy it, what is and isn&#8217;t currently in the packaged profile, what&#8217;s on deck to be in updated releases, and where to find help and participate with AS 7 and future packaging goals.  I was stumped though when asked about the differences between Fedora and AS 7 versus another distribution and Websphere.  I need to brush up on the features of other application servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>I&#8217;m not a well-rounded Fedora representative yet, but manning the booth was a huge kickstart. I learned the answers to tons of questions from the other Fedora representatives and discovered the concerns of potential and current Fedora users. The best thing about volunteering at the booth was meeting so many great people: the conference attendees who visited the booth and the Fedora advocates I had previously only chatted with on IRC. I can&#8217;t thank everyone enough times for answering my questions or for sorting through my jumbled explanations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    
  <p>Oh, there are two questions I can confidently respond to now without pause or consideration because Ruth wrote down the answers.</p>
